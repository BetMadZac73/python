      " The number of coronavirus patients on mechanical ventilation in the UK has passed 4,000 for the first time in the pandemic. A total of 4,076 Covid patients were on hospital ventilators as of Friday, according to government data. That is higher than during the first wave, when the peak was 3,301 on 12 April. It comes as another 1,348 deaths and 33,552 new infections were reported on Saturday. The UK's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, told a Downing Street news briefing on Friday: \"The death rate's awful and it's going to stay, I'm afraid, high for a little while before it starts coming down.\"\n",

      " The idea of a flat £500 payment to anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 has been dismissed by the UK government. Health officials had come up with the suggestion in the hope of encouraging people with the illness to self-isolate. There are concerns the virus is continuing to spread because some people are ignoring the instruction to stay home when they show symptoms or test positive. Downing Street has said there is already a £500 sum for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. But this must be applied for and there have been high rejection rates in England at least, A behaviour expert who advises the government, told the BBC  just 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolating for the full 10 days they were meant to. So how do other countries handle the question of paying people to stay at home, or just trusting they will do the right thing? Here, BBC correspondents from Prague to New York, offer an insight. In Portugal, even those who are just at-risk of contracting Covid - having been in direct contact with a confirmed case - are entitled to 100% of their basic salary, for 14 days, writes Alison Roberts, in Lisbon. For those who show symptoms, or have tested positive, the same is available for up to 28 days. And the normal waiting times people are used to when claiming while ill have also been done away with - these Covid payments kick in on day one of isolation.\n",

Although he had just finished promising a small gathering of supporters that he would be back \"in some form\", the future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Just two months ago, he seemed poised to be a powerful force in American politics even after his November defeat. He was still beloved by Republicans, feared and respected by the party's politicians and viewed positively by nearly half of Americans, according to public opinion surveys. Then Trump spent two months trafficking in unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud, feuded with party officials in battleground states, unsuccessfully campaigned for two Republican incumbent senators in Georgia's run-off elections and instigated a crowd of supporters that would turn into a mob that attacked the US Capitol.\n",

She said: \"Those sort of clickbait media get spread far quicker. So we've almost got to educate around internet safety.\"\n",

      " A light aircraft pilot who landed at a closed RAF base during lockdown \"to see the beach\" has been fined. Richard Charles Priestley Wood, 60, of Crescent Place, London, landed without permission at RAF Valley, on Anglesey, on 25 May. When stopped by fire crews he was dressed in shorts and said: \"It's OK I had Covid two months ago.\" He was fined £3,400 after pleading guilty to flying without obtaining information to enable a safe flight. Caernarfon Magistrates' Court heard how Wood had landed at the base on the bank holiday when there was no air traffic control on duty, and Wales was in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n",

      " Students across the UK are working and attending lectures from home – and many aren’t even in the same city as their university. That’s because the government guidance is for universities to teach online “as much as possible”. But this means thousands of students are paying for halls they’re not living in. And that’s led some of them to start rent strikes. Three students – from Manchester, Bristol and Kent universities – tell Radio 1 Newsbeat why they’ve decided to stop paying rent. The movement started at Manchester and has now grown to a network of students from over 50 universities.\n",

Almost half (48%) said they were less physically active than before the lockdown.  Another study by the Institute for Employment Studies found 35% reporting new back pain while working from home.

The exquisitely crafted, beautifully written, brilliantly acted French comedy-drama series about life in a Parisian talent agency is close to perfection, unlike its protagonists who are marvellously flawed. The show, which started in 2015, has developed over four series and five years from a cult hit into a lockdown sensation.  Season Four has just launched on Netflix, which will be the programme's last hurrah apparently. Let's hope the producers' word is as reliable as the double-crossing, endlessly conniving mavericks running the fictional ASK agency.

During his six-decade career, which included 25 years hosting his own nightly programme on CNN, King interviewed many of the most famous political leaders, celebrities and sports people of the day. At its peak, his Larry King Live Show on CNN was bringing in 1.5 million viewers a night. When the final episode aired in 2010, it was the longest-running show hosted by the same person. In a recorded message on his final show, then-US President Barack Obama said King had \"opened our eyes to the world beyond our living rooms\". CNN said he had been described as the \"Muhammad Ali of the broadcast interview\". Larry King was born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger in Brooklyn, New York, in 1933. He grew up in a religious and observant Jewish household, although in later life he became an agnostic. After the death of his father Edward at just 44, King worked to support his mother for several years after graduating high school.</p><a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-55773591'><h3>Covid hand-outs: How other countries pay if you are sick</h3></a><p> The idea of a flat £500 payment to anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 has been dismissed by the UK government.

There are concerns the virus is continuing to spread because some people are ignoring the instruction to stay home when they show symptoms or test positive. Downing Street has said there is already a £500 sum for those on low incomes who could not work from home and had to isolate. But this must be applied for and there have been high rejection rates in England at least, A behaviour expert who advises the government, told the BBC  just 18% of people with symptoms were self-isolating for the full 10 days they were meant to. So how do other countries handle the question of paying people to stay at home, or just trusting they will do the right thing? Here, BBC correspondents from Prague to New York, offer an insight. In Portugal, even those who are just at-risk of contracting Covid - having been in direct contact with a confirmed case - are entitled to 100% of their basic salary, for 14 days, writes Alison Roberts, in Lisbon. For those who show symptoms, or have tested positive, the same is available for up to 28 days. And the normal waiting times people are used to when claiming while ill have also been done away with - these Covid payments kick in on day one of isolation.</p><a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55735630'><h3>Side-by-side in a mosque - funerals and a food bank</h3></a><p> A mosque in east London has closed for all communal prayer. Instead it is serving two purposes - providing funerals and feeding the local community. Michael Buchanan finds a team of volunteers there battling to deal with the pandemic. The family shuffled quietly past a crate of milk cartons. They came through the small porch, towards the open coffin. Inside was a woman - a loved one - who died of Covid two days ago. The coffin sat feet away from tins and packets to be distributed by the local food bank. The milk was the latest delivery.  It is impossible to capture the enormous consequences of the pandemic. But last Saturday lunchtime, this tragic image - one of grief and hardship coming together - came close, for me at least.  Covid-19 has made extraordinary demands of so many different people, but what is currently happening at the Masjid Ibrahim and Islamic Centre in east London is truly remarkable. Situated on a busy road, with the noise of ambulance sirens regularly shattering its peaceful interior, the mosque has closed to communal prayer and is open for two other purposes - to provide a funeral service and a food bank to the local community. Both are inundated.  \"We've had so many bodies coming in. It's quite shocking. It's one after another after another. We've never had that situation before,\" says Sofia Bhatti. Alongside her friend, Tabassum Khokhar - known as Tabs - the pair are unheralded heroes. They volunteer to wash the bodies of Covid-positive women prior to burial. </p><a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-55773123'><h3>What next for Trump - and Trumpism?</h3></a><p> By Anthony ZurcherNorth America reporter Donald Trump boarded Air Force One for the last time on Wednesday with a wave. As Frank Sinatra's My Way blared over the loudspeakers at Joint Base Andrews, the soon-to-be-ex-president took off for his new home in Florida. Although he had just finished promising a small gathering of supporters that he would be back \"in some form\", the future for Trump - and the political movement he rode to victory in 2016 - is murky. Just two months ago, he seemed poised to be a powerful force in American politics even after his November defeat. He was still beloved by Republicans, feared and respected by the party's politicians and viewed positively by nearly half of Americans, according to public opinion surveys. Then Trump spent two months trafficking in unsubstantiated allegations of electoral fraud, feuded with party officials in battleground states, unsuccessfully campaigned for two Republican incumbent senators in Georgia's run-off elections and instigated a crowd of supporters that would turn into a mob that attacked the US Capitol.</p><a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-55765555'><h3>Stunt king to the stars who fell to Covid</h3></a><p> By Hugh SchofieldBBC News, Paris Rémy Julienne was one of the world's best-known stuntmen, devising the crashes, crunches and collisions of more than 1,400 films.

BBC analysis in 2020 showed nine out of 10 major local authorities in England did not have enough cash to cover their spending plans this year, and coronavirus could lead to them going £1.7bn over budget. Now, a committee of MPs has criticised the Treasury for its \"worryingly laissez faire attitude\" to the state of local government finances, warning of a \"significant risk\" that Town Hall debts could drag down the \"whole of government\". The department says it provided \"a significant funding uplift for councils\" at last year's Spending Review, on top of additional funding \"to ensure they can continue to deliver essential local services as we tackle the impacts of the pandemic\".</p><a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-55704869'><h3>Shetland space launch plans submitted</h3></a><p> Plans for a space launch facility in Shetland, which it's claimed could support hundreds of jobs, have been formally submitted.

The unnamed imposter, he said, went as far as to present his work at conferences. Dr Lodder said it was \"pretty creepy\".

Full back Tony Claypole, 83, made more than 125 appearances for Northampton Town until a broken leg ended his professional career in 1962. His daughter-in-law Jo Claypole said he remembered his time as a player but would often not recognise his wife. \"The kindness of strangers has been amazing,\" she said. Claypole has vascular dementia and Alzheimer's and has deteriorated in the past six months, which prompted Ms Claypole to search for matchday programmes, photos and other memorabilia. </p><a href='https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-55741095'><h3>GP posts TikTok videos to tackle vaccine fake news</h3></a><p> A GP has used social media networks including TikTok to urge people not to fall for misinformation about the Covid vaccination.

That’s because the government guidance is for universities to teach online “as much as possible”. But this means thousands of students are paying for halls they’re not living in. And that’s led some of them to start rent strikes. Three students – from Manchester, Bristol and Kent universities – tell Radio 1 Newsbeat why they’ve decided to stop paying rent.
